# Command Line For The Win

Here I tackled the CMD CHALLENGE.
The challenge is a pretty cool game to improvebash skills.

## Steps - file transfer using SFTP
1. I created an sftp connection to my sandbox by copying the sftp link and pasting it in my computer terminal
2. Next I inserted the password to establish the link
3. I navigated to the desired folder /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/
4. I navigated to the folder where my screenshots were saved on my system using the lcd command
5. I uploaded the screenshots individually using the put command:
put 1-next_9_tasks.png
6. I exited the stfp connection
7. From my sandbox, I pushed the uploaded files to my github.

# 0x10 HTTPS SSL :wrench:

At the end of this project, I was able to know:

* The 2 main roles of HTTPS SSL 
* What is the purpose encrypting traffic
* What SSL termination means

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:
0. Bash script that will display information about subdomains.
1. certificate using certbot and configure HAproxy to accept encrypted traffic for your subdomain www..
2. Script that configures HAproxy to automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
